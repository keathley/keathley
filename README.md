### Hey, I'm Chris Keathley

I'm a software engineer, building high performance, resilient systems.
I do almost all of my work in Elixir and Erlang and have built a number of
open source libraries to make it easier to build and test high-scale, distributed systems.

I've been passionate about Elixir for a number of years and that's lead me
to write a [few blog posts](https://keathley.io) and give a [bunch of talks](https://keathley.io/talks) on a variety
of elixir and erlang related topics.

If you've found some value in any of the stuff I've worked on and you have a few
bucks to spare, maybe consider [sponsoring me on Github](https://github.com/sponsors/keathley).

I'm currently exploring new opportunities so if you're looking for someone with
my skill set feel free to email me at c@keathley.io.
